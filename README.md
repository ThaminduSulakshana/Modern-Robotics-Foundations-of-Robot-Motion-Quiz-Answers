# Modern Robotics: Foundations of Robot Motion - Quiz Answers
Course 1: Foundations of Robot Motion from the "Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control" specialization by Northwestern University. This repository contains my quiz answers and related materials for the course.

## Course Overview
In this course, we cover fundamental topics related to robot configurations, configuration space (C-space), degrees of freedom, spatial velocities and forces, and holonomic vs nonholonomic constraints. We use the textbook "Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control" (Lynch and Park, Cambridge University Press 2017) as our primary reference.
